# Add Member

Not sure if this is the acutal thing or older version :(

## Notes
Following changes are done before pushing it to git:
- remove credentials.txt file as it has my credential, you can refer credentials.txt.sample for reference
- remove private value from addMember.py -> {api_id, api_hash, phone}, you can use your thing there
- remove private value from scraper.py -> {api_id, api_hash, phone}, you can use your thing there
- remove all the .csv file, I guess those are created the application while running it, so not an issue, but it container confidential data

There are some automatation done as well, as one id support just a few addition of member so we had to use multiple telegram account, refer Auto Member Adder

I am damm sure this is not the latest one we are using currently, will find the the one and update here but for now have this one :)
