# Cristro Bot
This is for managing a Group on Telegram, where we used to play Ludo :), you know

## Notes
Forgot most of the thing :(, the change I made before pushing this are
- delete the actual cristrobot.json file and instead created a cristrobot.json.sample, you need to use actual value from your account with proper permission(admin should work)
- deleted allowed group id from index.js -> allowedGroups
- deleted telegram token from message.js -> Message -> _token
